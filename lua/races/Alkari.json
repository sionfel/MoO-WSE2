-- Race Name: Alkari
-- Description: The Alkari are an avian race descended from great flying reptiles. Reared as fliers, Alkari pilots have an almost instinctive grasp of the dynamics of three-dimensional motion. 
-- As a result, Alkari ships gain a 40% defensive bonus in space combat. Long ago, the Alkari home world was once a colony of the powerful Orion empire. The ancient artifacts left from that time give their researchers an advantage. 
-- The Alkari government is a Dictatorship.
